# Machine Learning Unsupervised Learning Project

Welcome to our machine learning project focused on unsupervised learning techniques.
This repository contains the code and materials for exploring various unsupervised learning algorithms.
The project was developed in collaboration with my teammate [StevanGrujic](https://github.com/StevanGrujic).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to delve into the realm of unsupervised learning and investigate different algorithms and their applications.
We have explored a range of unsupervised learning techniques.
Each algorithm has been implemented and evaluated on relevant datasets to gain insights into their strengths, limitations, and real-world use cases.
The code, experiments, and results are documented in the project notebooks.
